StudyPal-paper
==============

This is the paper for HCI.
The source can either be edited locally if you install all the LaTex stuff  
or you can edit using a web app called ShareLatex ([repo](https://www.sharelatex.com/project/547344452890775a20cc7da1)).

If using ShareLaTex, make sure you go to the menu in the upper left and "Push changes to GitHub" since
it doesn't auto sync.

And feel free to not use sharelatex, I like it since I have a bad laptop and don't want to install all the stuff on it.
